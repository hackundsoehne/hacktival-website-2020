#### What size can a team be?

Teams can be up to 4 people. If you want to hack alone, that’s totally fine. If you are still looking for a team, don’t worry, we will have team building session at the event.

An official photo ID, a laptop and its charger. That’s about it!

We want you to have a great time and tons of fun. Just make yourself comfortable and we’re sure that you’ll take an awesome idea from concept to reality and enjoy yourself.

#### Where can I sleep?

All-nighters are cool, but if you need some rest, we’ve got you covered. We have a quiet little room where you can take a nap. However, we do not provide any sleeping equipment, so please bring a sleeping bag or whatever else you need to sleep comfortably.

#### How do I get there?

The event is hosted at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany. Tram line 2 brings you from the main station to the ZKM. Get out at the stop “ZKM” or “Arbeitsagentur”, both are only a few minutes away from the hackathon.
