Maik Hummel (@beevelop) is managing director and CTO of Neohelden GmbH from Karlsruhe and is responsible for the development of the Neo Enterprise Assistant Platform.

Before he started working in different start-ups, the trained business information scientist gained several years of experience as an IT consultant in the finance-, insurance- and automotive industries.
