Alexander is co-founder of First Momentum Ventures and Blockinfinity.

As the first student venture capital fund in Germany, First Momentum Ventures closes the existing financing gap in the early phase. The aim is to identify the next generation of founders, to meet them at eye level and to support them in their endeavour by providing access to capital, know-how and relevant partners.

At Blockinfinity, he implements blockchain-based solutions for various customers, from conception to implementation. By working for energy suppliers he can contribute thereby to the energy transition.

Alexander himself is enthusiastic about hackathons - both as a participant and organizer.
